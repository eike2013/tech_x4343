Summary: Building my first case for the Raspberry Pi with OLED SSD1306 from Adafruit

# Introduction

This post is about my first case I used to build some month ago.
The idea was to have some sort of DIY touch and to have the perfect enclosure for my Raspberry Pi which works as a Media Center under my flat screen.
I attached the nice 128x32 SPI OLED SSD1306 from Adafruit, which works perfectly with the libraries provided by [GuyC@Gaugette](http://guy.carpenter.id.au/gaugette/blog/categories/raspberry-pi/).

So this post is more or less just a protocol of the building process, because I think it's worth sharing.
It took my a while to get everything working because a lack of motivation and time...but in some weeks I think, it will be done!
The last part will be to program some status information from the running XBMC like meta data, play/pause/stopp/volume, playback time etc...
It's just for fun, because no one can read it from 2-3 meters distance ;)

PS: It's called Case #1, because I've already another one half finished.
