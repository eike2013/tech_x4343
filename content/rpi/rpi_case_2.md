Summary: Building my second case for the Raspberry Pi

# Introduction

For my second Raspberry Pi case I want to add a USB Hub right under the Pi. It annoys me to put the hub beneath the Pi everytime I need more then two USB ports - which is very often.

So I put out the PCB from an old D-Link USB 2.0 Hub with nearly the same measurements than the Pi itself.

After this, I designed a minimalistic case with Inventor. The target was to construct it with acrylic glass. It turned out to be a good idea and an educational process for myself.

Working with acrylic glass is very easy. You just need a dovetail saw, a dremel, a hot blow dryer, some fine sandpaper (> 800) and - if you like - some color.
 
# The Drawing

First a fast sketch on paper...

and then some drawings I made with Inventor. They are very straight forward. Just two parts with sufficient bending radius.

## Building Process

The building and coloring process took several hours of work.

The longest part was the preparation of the acrylic glass: Sawing, deburring, sanding and coloring.
After this I made two wood templates for the bending as you can see in the pictures. Bending acrylic glass is a lot of fun. It's getting really elastic when it's hot enough.
Just make sure to have a pair of good isolated gloves. And very important: Don't use a thermoconductive template. Wood is a good selection.

A last check if the result still sticks to the drawing dimensions.

Keeping both parts in the desired position during the curing time (1-2 minutes).

In the last two pictures you see how I insert the USB hub and fix it with velcro fastener. That's it for now, because I lend my second Raspberry Pi to a friend of mine. So I haven't mounted it yet.
I'll post a last picture asap, but the most interesting part of the building process is already done!
