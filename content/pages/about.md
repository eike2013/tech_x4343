This is more a documentary about things I'm doing than a blog.

I'm trying to track my most important projects here and update the posts regularly.

Some words about me:
I'm currently 24 years old and very interested in electrical engineering && computation.

Some topics which interest me most are Linux, Free Software, Arduino && Attiny, Software Defined Radio, Signal && Systemtheory (especially GNSS && DGPS) and a bit of 
IT Security (Cryptography etc.).

I'm trying to cover them all every now and then!
