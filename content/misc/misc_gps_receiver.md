Summary: Pictures of professional two-frequency GNSS receivers

# Trimble Ag361

The Trimble Ag361 Receiver is a high-level L1 & L1 GPS Receiver with RTK functionality.
It's some years old and not able to receiver GLONASS.
But I think it's still worth to take a look in the inside of such an interesting piece of hardware.

# Hemisphere GPS, R220

Here you see a newer generation of GNSS receiver. The R220 from Hemisphere GPS (*or* AgJunction for agricultural applications).
It's capable to receive GPS and GLONASS with RTK correction.

It can output RAW data or act as an RTK base - but this features must be unlocked with codes.
